# BLUTOOTH_CONTROLLED_CAR_USING-8051
This project aims to develop a Bluetooth-controlled car utilizing the 8051 microcontroller, with a mobile phone serving as the remote control unit. 

With the widespread availability of smartphones and Bluetooth technology, this system offers a convenient and intuitive interface for remotely controlling the car's movements. Mobile phone serves as medium of transferring commands from user side to the proposed system.


The remote control unit is a smartphone equipped with a custom-designed mobile application. The application establishes a Bluetooth connection with
the car, enabling bidirectional communication between the phone and the car's onboard 8051 microcontroller. Users can control the car's direction by sending commands through the mobile application's user interface.


On the car side, another Bluetooth module is interfaced with the 8051
microcontroller, allowing it to receive control signals from the smartphone. The microcontroller processes these signals and activates the appropriate motors or actuators  to execute the desired actions, such as moving forward, backward , turning left or turning right
Key features of the system include:

Smartphone-based remote control interface, providing users with a familiar and accessible means of controlling the car.
Bluetooth connectivity for wireless communication, enabling untethered operation and increased mobility.
Real-time responsiveness, ensuring immediate feedback and smooth execution of control commands.
Expandability and customization options, allowing for the integration of additional sensors or functionalities to enhance the car's capabilities.


The proposed Bluetooth-controlled car offers a versatile platform for exploring concepts in embedded systems, microcontroller programming, and mobile
application development. It not only serves as an engaging educational tool but also holds potential for practical applications in areas such as robotics, automation, and entertainment.
